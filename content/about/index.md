My friends call me Claude.I’ve been a computer enthusiast for about 40 years, 25 of which I’ve been very lucky to spend with them either in academia, in startup companies, and/or in a hobby relationship.

I have a super wide interest (admittedly much focussed on technology) and really like being able to deep-dive into something.
I keep asking myself "why" and "how" and "is there a better way".
Whenever I discover something, I try to share it here on the blog; the blog posts are for me, but certainly also meant for the rest of the world.

What generally happens is that I'm looking for some information.
When I cannot find it, I spend some time finding out what I was looking for.
Then I spend some more time and some more time and then some more, understanding what I just did, and how it works.
Finally, I write it all down.
With the intention that I can find it back later, while also hoping that it will be useful for someone else.


I like my privacy and I like to read articles withouty constantly being interrupted by advertisements. That's why you don't see any advertisements on this blog, nor will you be tracked.
Did you notice the cookie banner when you first arrived? That's because you can bring your own cookies (if you want), we don't serve any[^cookies].

In exchange, I would be very happy if you show your appreciation of my work, by leaving a comment below, on a post that you like (or dislike), or on my [GitHub page][3].


I am definitely looking for something new to get excited about. I am a do-er; I love to spend hours, or days, fixating on a small problem, making the big fix.
Over the years this has meant developing massively parallel database architectures (before everyone was doing this), writing an LLVM patch to generate slightly faster ARM machine code, working on a compiler to automatically generate code that can run on the GPU, and setting up massively scaled cloud architectures.
Over the past months I follow where I see problems that interest me.
Learning about Web Assembly, and how to compile code to run on it, fighting with optimization problems, looking into WebXR and game development for VR head sets.

If something truly amazing comes along, I'm available for work!
The problem however is that I'm already getting lots of requests from recruiters to talk without me having stated that I might be available.
So in order to avoid me getting flooded by requests, let's set up a small rule: if you seriously think that you have something amazing to offer, make a €10 donation to a charity in my name, show me the receipt and I'm more than happy to promise you a 10 minute video chat (selection of charity needs to be reasonable -- however worst that can happen if you give to an unreasonable charity is that I know up front that we're not going to match).
