Privacy is important!
Everyone tells you so, and usually this means "Hey, we only intend to sell your data to anyone with money. We won't give it away for free. Just don't read our fine-print and you will never know".

On this site, things work differently.

1. Be welcome. We don't want to know who you are.
1. This website served no cookies (you better bring your own if you want some[^want-some]).
1. Initially I launched this site without any analytics, but it's hard to keep motivated to write, if you don't know if anyone ever reads it. Therefore I know have some privacy-safe analytics, done through [Get Insight][1]. They do not track you, only let me know some bare-minimum information on the visits. Check [their privacy policy][2].
1. In order to allow some feedback, I have a comment section run through [giscus][3], which uses GitHub to manage comments. You can read up on what they do (and what GitHub does) in [their privacy policy][4].
1. The website is hosted on AWS, which means that I pay a fair price (a couple of euro-cents a month) for hosting, which also means that you don't pay for it with your data.

[^want-some]: If you really want some cookies with your blog, open the developer console, and type `document.cookie = "chocolatecunk=good; path=/";`. I cannot imagine what good it will do, but choice is freedom.
